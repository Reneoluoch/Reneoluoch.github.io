         <h3>üîπ Project: Packet Tracer ‚Äì TCP/IP & OSI Models in Action</h3>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>
In this immersive assignment, I utilized Cisco Packet Tracer to dissect how data flows through the OSI and TCP/IP models during web and DNS communications. The lab provided both a theoretical and practical understanding of network packet behavior across layers, encapsulation processes, protocol interactions, and real-time packet analysis. Observing the detailed journey of HTTP requests and DNS resolutions significantly deepened my grasp of fundamental networking concepts.
</p>

<p><strong>Key Concepts Covered:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Practical analysis of OSI and TCP/IP model layers using simulation tools</li>
  <li>Detailed inspection of encapsulated HTTP requests, DNS lookups, and ARP queries</li>
  <li>Understanding port numbers, MAC address resolution, IP packet structure, and TCP connection states</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Practical Experience:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Used Packet Tracer's Simulation Mode to capture and analyze HTTP and DNS traffic flows</li>
  <li>Identified data behavior across OSI layers‚Äîfrom Layer 7 (Application) to Layer 1 (Physical)</li>
  <li>Interpreted the TCP three-way handshake and termination process, including ESTABLISHED and CLOSED states</li>
  <li>Resolved DNS queries and verified server response IP addresses and port behavior (HTTP on port 80, DNS on port 53)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Outcome:</strong></p>
<p>
This project sharpened my practical networking skills, reinforcing theoretical knowledge with packet-level insights. It empowered me to understand and explain the mechanics of web and DNS traffic handling, identify encapsulation processes across each OSI layer, and utilize packet analysis tools effectively. This assignment marked a foundational step toward mastering network diagnostics, protocol behavior, and secure, efficient network communication.

           <h3>üîπ Project: Wireshark ‚Äì Analyzing Local and Remote Network Traffic</h3>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>
This assignment used <strong>Wireshark</strong> to explore network traffic with a focus on <strong>ICMP packets</strong>, ARP behavior, and the relationship between Layer 2 and Layer 3 in local and remote scenarios. Through targeted ping commands and traffic analysis, I gained valuable insights into how packets are constructed, transmitted, and interpreted across networks. This hands-on lab provided a clear view of how devices communicate within the LAN and how data travels across the internet via IP routing.
</p>

<p><strong>Key Concepts Covered:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>ICMP traffic analysis in local and remote network communication</li>
  <li>ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) and MAC resolution on local networks</li>
  <li>TTL (Time to Live) in IP packets and hop count interpretation</li>
  <li>Ethernet frame structures and encapsulation behavior within LANs</li>
  <li>Wireshark as a tool for live traffic inspection and protocol dissection</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Practical Experience:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Used <code>ipconfig</code> and <code>arp -a</code> commands to retrieve local IP and MAC details</li>
  <li>Captured and analyzed ICMP Echo Requests/Replies to both the default gateway and external websites (Google, Cisco, Yahoo)</li>
  <li>Observed how ARP resolves MAC addresses only within local networks</li>
  <li>Learned that Ethernet frames for remote communication use the gateway's MAC, not the final destination's</li>
  <li>Inspected TTL values to identify the number of hops between source and destination</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Outcome:</strong></p>
<p>
This lab enhanced my technical skills in network traffic analysis, highlighting the significance of ICMP, ARP, and IP in day-to-day communication. It demonstrated the layer-specific roles of protocols within the OSI model and clarified how Ethernet and IP function differently in local and remote scenarios. The lab also validated the importance of tools like Wireshark for diagnostics and protocol study, making this a vital step toward deeper proficiency in network operations and security analysis.

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>
This assignment explored the core principles of <strong>web communication</strong> using <strong>HTTP and HTTPS</strong> protocols. I studied how clients and servers exchange structured requests and responses, examined the anatomy of URLs, and learned to interpret HTTP status codes and methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Hands-on practice with tools like <code>cURL</code> and browser DevTools allowed me to craft, send, and analyze requests, gaining insight into how web applications handle data and authentication.
</p>

<p><strong>Key Concepts Covered:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>HTTP request and response structure and flow</li>
  <li>Differences between HTTP and HTTPS, including TLS encryption and secure communication</li>
  <li>HTTP headers and their roles in security, content negotiation, and session management</li>
  <li>Common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and how they relate to CRUD operations</li>
  <li>Interacting with APIs using RESTful principles and JSON payloads</li>
  <li>Authentication techniques such as HTTP Basic Auth and cookie handling</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Practical Experience:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Used <code>cURL</code> commands to send and inspect HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses</li>
  <li>Explored request headers, response headers, and status codes via browser DevTools</li>
  <li>Authenticated to protected endpoints using Basic Authentication with credentials in headers and URLs</li>
  <li>Manipulated GET parameters and POST JSON payloads to interact with web services and search functions</li>
  <li>Performed full CRUD operations on an API endpoint using REST methods and JSON formatting</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Outcome:</strong></p>
<p>
This lab deepened my understanding of web protocols and practical skills in constructing, analyzing, and manipulating HTTP traffic. I learned how encryption secures data in transit, how APIs operate through RESTful conventions, and how authentication and headers govern access and communication. These skills are foundational for web application security testing, automation, and troubleshooting.
